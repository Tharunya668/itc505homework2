<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<p>Incorporating diversity considerations in research, development, and innovation has become an increasingly importanttopic. It is a well-known fact that diverse teams produce better outcomes, whereas the lack of diversity might result in biased and discriminatory technologies. Therefore, the inclusion of
diverse stakeholders is considered paramount for the creation of an ethical and social-responsible future. With this study,we aim to contribute to the conversation on how EDI (equity, diversity, inclusion) can be implemented in SoftwareEngineering (SE) research. In our study, we focus on SE research that includes research participants since this is an evident opportunity to consider diversity, and we investigate to which extent and with what purpose SE researchers consider and report diversity in their research papers. Our results demonstrate that only a few studies do not consider diversity at all, however, the examined studies differ greatly in the range of the consideration and reporting of diversity.

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>In recent years, the consideration of the diversity of people who are involved in research and innovation has become an increasingly important topic. Diversity of developers and researchers is regarded – and has already been proven -beneficial for numerous reasons: diverse teams produce better outcomes, research and development that systematically includes diversity are of benefit for a broader population whereas the lack of diversity might result in biased and discriminatory technologies, the inclusion of diverse stakeholders is paramount for the creation of an ethical and social-responsible future, and, last but not least, excluding large parts of society from research and the development. of future technologies violates human rights. One size does not fit all, and this applies to research and development,too. To mitigate the negative effects of non-diverse research and to stimulate researchers to incorporate diversity in their research, national and international research funding programs are developing policies and guidelines for equity, diversity, and
inclusion (EDI), for responsible research and innovation (RRI) to bind the research funding to increasingly important conditions: the sufficient consideration of EDI.In our study, we focus on research that includes research participants as we regard this as an evident opportunity for
SE researchers to include diversity considerations in their research. Therefore, our research questions are as follows:
• RQ1. To what extent do SE participant studies report thediversity of participants?
• RQ2. What diversity categories are reported in SE participant studies?
• RQ3. What is the function of diversity in SE participant studies?
To capture all variants of diversity categories, we choose an inductive approach, which means: we do not predefine the categories to examine the content according to these categories. Instead, we reconstruct the diversity categories through open coding of the content. Therefore, for the purpose of this
study, we choose a broader definition of diversity categories: A diversity category is a category based on which individuals (in our case, research participants) are distinguished and grouped.This open approach allows for identifying categories that might be relevant for research but are not included in the commonly discussed diversity categories such as gender, race, and ethnicity, amongst others.Our results demonstrate that only a few studies do not
consider diversity at all, however, the examined studies differ greatly in the range of the consideration and reporting of diversity. From these outcomes, we draw the conclusion of differences in diversity awareness among SE researchers. We propose a model of diversity awareness for participant studies
as a tool to support SE researchers in reflecting on diversity and incorporating it systematically in their research. Finally, we publish our classification coding scheme and the dataset used to conduct this study to encourage further studies on diversity awareness and facilitate replicability.

<h3>Related Work:</h3>

 <p1>Time and time again, diversity, and the importance of diversity, has been a topic of discussion for many researchers in various fields. This has led to different definitions of diversity 1https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7587076 emerging in different contexts. In recent years, diversity, especially gender diversity, has received increasing attention in the field of SE. Lack of Diversity in SE. The issue of lack of diversity, also
referred to as the diversity crisis, in SE has been investigated by many SE research papers as can be seen in the IEEE special issue article by Albusays et al. The importance of diversity and inclusion in the field of SE has been clearly stated in the article with one of the questions being “What are the relevant diversity parameters we should consider when exploring software development practices and technology”. Tamtik notes that only understanding diversity in terms of gender, language, and socio-economic categories limits the understanding of diversity. Similarly, Rodriguez and Nadri et al. conclude that more perceived diversity aspects need to be considered in SE research. One of the goals of our research is to address these challenges in the context
of SE research, by (i) revealing how SE researchers are addressing diversity in their studies and reporting about it in their publications, and (ii) by providing SE researchers with guidelines they can use when conducting participant studies. Other work by Menezes and Prikladnicki investigated various publications about diversity in SE by performing a literature review. They also investigated the impact of diversity on processes in software development by conducting semistructured interviews. They concluded that many challenges still need to be overcome to make SE work environments more diverse. Our work complements the work by Menzes and Prikladnicki since we investigate to what extent SE research considers diversity, the types of categories used and
the function of diversity.Human Values in SE Research. Perera et al. examine to what extent human values are considered in SE research instead of
diversity. They use a similar methodology to ours, where they analyze research papers from top-tier SE conferences and journals to assess their consideration of human values. The found that very few SE publications consider human values. Storey et al. conducted a similar study where they
investigate the consideration of human aspects in SE research by analyzing SE research papers. They found most SE
studies focus on technical aspects of SE even though these studies claim to impact human stakeholders. Storey et al.concluded that there is a need for SE studies to consider more human aspects and recommended a framework they created that can be used to consider more human and social aspects
in SE research. Although the work by Perera et al. and Storey et al. used a similar approach to ours, these two studies investigate the considerations of human aspects/values in SE research whereas we study the consideration of diversity in SE research, more specifically participant studies, while providing
guidelines for SE researchers conducting participant studies.The work closest to ours is the work by Lenarduzzi et al. who investigated participant studies in SE, where they examined the current participant selection guidelines and practices in empirical SE research. They analyze existing guidelines for participant selection in SE and present the participant selection strategies being currently used in their results. Our work complements their study since we study actual research papers involving participants and create guidelines for SE researchers, whereas their study only examined guidelines
(and not actual research papers).</p1>

<h3> Methodology:</h3>

<p> The goal of our research is to examine to which extent diversity is considered in SE research and to provide guidelines toSE researchers that they can use when conducting participant studies. As a methodological approach, we apply qualitative and quantitative content analysis [27] [28] where we used open
coding and axial coding methods [29] to examine software engineering research papers which include participant studies. Due to the novel nature of this study, we start by performing a pilot study to assess the viability of this study and develop an appropriate framework. Fig. 1 shows an overview of our methodology. As the first step, we selected a venue to collect data for our study. Then, we conducted a pilot study to assess the viability of our study and establish a coding scheme. After the coding scheme was developed, we extended the data collection process to include more studies with participants. To collect our sample data, we filtered through abstracts of research papers from our selected venues to identify studies with participants. Once we gathered our data, the first author read each paper and classified each study according to our coding scheme. We
leveraged a mixed methods approach that uses qualitative and quantitative methods to reach our results. A. Research Questions To assess to what extent SE research papers with participants display diversity awareness, we first investigate if SE research papers report on diversity in their studies: RQ1. To what extent do SE participant studies report the diversity of participants? After examining whether diversity is even reported, we set out to identify the kinds of diversity reported: RQ2. What diversity categories are reported in SE participant studies? Finally, after assessing what kind of diversity categories can
be identified in SE research with participants, we investigate if the reported diversity is actually analysed/leveraged throughout the research paper:
RQ3. What is the function of diversity in SE participant studies? B. Selecting the Target Venue To take a more systematic approach, we collected the sample for this research from the International Conference of Software Engineering proceedings (ICSE). We choose ICSE as our venue because it is considered the flagship software engineering conference [30] and the proceedings of ICSE are easily accessible online [31]. We collected our sample from ICSE 2019, 2020 and 2021 technical tracks to enrich the sample of studies and ensure our findings cover multiple editions of the conference. In total, the technical track of ICSE 2019, 2020, and 2021 contained 379 papers. Sampling three venues were also in line with software engineering metastudies, such as the study of Storey et al. [25], which used two venues, ICSE 2017 technical track and ESME 2017 paper, as their sample. For completeness, we list below all of the inclusion criteria used for the data set of our study:
• Technical research track papers from ICSE 2019, 2020 and 2021.
• Studies that contained participants such as surveys, control groups, action research, grounded theory, focus groups, interviews, field studies, lab studies, validationstudies, task-based studies and judgement studies.
• Studies with one or more participants
C. Selecting Papers with Participant Studies Software engineering research employs a variety of research methods. As we are interested in studies with participants, we need to identify papers that have employed a particular set of methods, e.g., surveys, interviews, field studies, etc. To this aim, we read the abstracts of all 376 papers in the technical research track of ICSE, from 2019 to 2021. We choose to read the abstracts of each paper in order to
find research papers containing participant studies. Abstracts often convey the main methodology of a research therefore if a participant study was conducted as part of a research, it would likely be mentioned in the abstract. This is particularly the case with participant studies, as the inclusion of interviews and surveys with practitioners is well-valued by the SE community. Analyzing paper abstracts is commonly used in related literature when conducting similar content analyses.Given our initial sample contains 379 papers, reading the abstracts was a suitable and efficient method for filtering
papers that are candidates for containing participant studies. To select papers with participant studies, we identified words and phrases that indicated that the research involves research participants. Some examples of these words and phrases are given in Table. I. Sometimes, the abstract of a paper does not explicitly describe the entire methodology adopted by the studies. In the case of only implicit indication of research involving participants, we read the entire paper for verification. For example, in the following abstract, the indication of a studywith research participants is not clear.</p>

All researchers involved in this study are between 27-40 years old, 80% of the researchers are male, and no researcher has color vision deficiency or a physical disability.</p>

<h3>Result:</h3>

<p>The goal of our overall research is to assess the diversity awareness in software engineering research with participants.To do so, we first want to know if researchers report any kind of diversity data about participants (RQ1); what kind of diversity they report (RQ2); and the function of diversity in the software research (RQ3). The aforementioned research questions help us assess the awareness of diversity in software engineering participant research. A. RQ1. To what extent do SE participant studies report the diversity of participants? The first step to understanding the awareness of diversity in SE research is to examine how often SE studies report the diversity of their participants. This analysis will help us understand how well-established are the practices of collecting, analyzing and reporting demographic data about participants. Hence, to answer RQ1, we performed the qualitative content analysis described in Section III-E. We also break our results by type of participant study (e.g., survey, task-based) and for this purpose we rely on how researchers describe their own study. We found that 98.01% of the examined participant studies report the diversity of participants. Out of our sample of 105 studies that we analyzed in our research, 103 studies used descriptive words and phrases when characterizing participants. Only 2 studies out of 105 did not report any participant diversity. To make better sense of the results, we break our analysis per type of participant study in Table III. First, we note that SE papers use participant studies on 11 different study modalities,the most common being: surveys (51 studies), task-based (33 studies), interviews (22 studies), and validation (19 studies). Second, most types of studies tend to report an average of 3 different categories when describing the participants, with Lab studies reporting the highest average (4.6 categories) across the samples we investigated. Some studies, such as tasked-based and lab studies, reported a wide array of diversity categories when describing participants, including 8 different types of descriptors.Our results indicate that the practice of reporting participant diversity is well-established in participant studies in Software Engineering. Researchers tend to select between 2-4 categories of descriptors when describing participants. Only in rare cases (2 out of 105 studies) do researchers omit to describe the participants included in their study. The number of studies surpasses 105, as a participant study may involve multiple study types (e.g., interviews and surveys). The study type is based on how the authors describe their own study. B. RQ2. What diversity categories are reported in SE participant studies? After determining that most SE participant studies do report aspects of participant diversity, we want to identify what kinds of diversity are reported. Such analysis will help us better understand what characteristics of participant diversity are emphasized by SE researchers and the aspects that might be overlooked and require more attention. To answer RQ2, we created a coding scheme where we identified descriptors about participants in SE studies. We then grouped similar descriptors to form diversity categories as mentioned in section III-E. We found 12 different diversity categories reported in SE participant studies. Table IV shows the diversity categories we identify in the content analysis, as well as their definition and frequency (Freq) in our sample. The frequencies do not sum up to 100% as, on average, studies report multiple categories of diversities.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>In this paper, we examine the diversity considerations in SE participant studies. We apply content analysis to investigate participant studies from three ICSE technical tracks, from 2019 to 2021. Our investigation focused on understanding 1) the extent to which participants are described, 2) what diversity categories are more prominent in SE research, and 3) the function participant diversity serves in SE studies. On one hand, our findings shed light on some positive remarks for the SE research community. Reporting participant diversity is a well-established practice, with studies reporting on multiple characteristics of participants. On the other hand, our results also point to some gaps/challenges that may need further addressing. Studies emphasize participants’ professional backgrounds over their social backgrounds, which may prevent important reflections that are needed in a research community. Furthermore, participant diversity is often only reported initially in the studies, to describe participants, but is seldom analyzed or reflected upon, when researchers discuss their study results, outcomes and limitations. Our study sheds light on the strengths and gaps of diversity awareness in SE participant studies and provides a model that future studies can use to improve diversity awareness. This research is as a starting point for discussions about diversity awareness in SE participant research. There is a large potential for future work to assess the impact of the lack of diversity consideration in SE participant research, and it’s effect on representation and inclusion. Our model can also be applied to other engineering fields to uncover differences of reporting participant diversity across various engineering disciplines.</p>
